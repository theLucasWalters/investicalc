# Investicalc
I'm building a set of calculators for metrics useful in stock market investing.

# Details
This is still really early on, but my hopes are to make this a fully-fleshed calculator app for mobile and PC.
If you're interested in helping out, please do. Thanks ðŸ™‚

### Bugs
- CI Calculator doesn't work quite right\
For the Compound Interest calculator, entering 1 for all 3 values (principle, interest rate, # of compounding periods) calculates out to $0.01
when it should be $1.01.

- Second window opens on run\
When the program is run in the command line, a second unwanted Tk window opens alongside the primary one.
